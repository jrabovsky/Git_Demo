# What is Git?
Git is a version control system. A version control system is a piece of software designed to keep track of the changes made to files over time.
More specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that everyone working with a project in Git has a copy of the full
history of the project, not just the current state of the files.

# What is Github?
Github is a website where you can upload a copy of your Git repository. It provides a centralized location to share the repository, a web-based
interface to view it, and additional features which allow you to specify, discuss, and review changes.
